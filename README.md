# Generators in Python

## Introduction
Generators are a special type of iterable in Python that allow lazy evaluation using the `yield` keyword. They produce values one at a time and maintain their state between calls, making them memory-efficient.

## Key Concepts
- Use the `yield` keyword to return values  
- Resume execution from the last `yield` statement  
- Automatically implement the iterator protocol  
- Ideal for large data processing and infinite sequences  

## Topics to Learn
- Creating generator functions with `yield`  
- Using generator expressions  
- Differences between generators and normal functions  
- Advantages of generators over lists in terms of memory usage
